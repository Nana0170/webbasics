        <p>Soldiers lose their lives in war for many reasons: in direct combat, from ambushes, airstrikes, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and even friendly fire. Others die from exposure to extreme conditions, diseases, or lack of medical care in the field. </p>

    <div id="container">
        <p>Each soldier who dies is someone’s child, sibling, partner, or parent—leaving behind grieving families and communities.</p>
        <p>For families, the loss of a son, daughter, parent, sibling, or spouse in war is deeply personal and often traumatic. The grief is complicated by the circumstances of war—sudden, violent death, often far from home, and sometimes with little closure.</p>
        <p>Survivors may experience depression, anxiety, and in some cases, PTSD.Some feel anger—at the war, the government, or even the soldier themselves for leaving. Others may feel isolated, unable to relate to people who haven’t experienced a similar loss.</p>

    <h1 align="center"><b>3. mental health</b></h1>
    <div class="imageparagraph">
    <div id="container">
        <p>One of the most well-known mental health effects of war is PTSD. It can develop after a person experiences or witnesses life-threatening events such as combat, bombings, or the death of comrades.</p>

Symptoms may include:
<div>
<p>Nightmares and flashbacks
Severe anxiety and panic attacks
Emotional numbness
Avoidance of anything that reminds them of the trauma</p>
</div>

<p>Many veterans live with PTSD for years, sometimes without realizing it, and it can interfere with relationships, work, and everyday life.</p>

<p>Even those who survive physically often face deep psychological wounds. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), survivor's guilt, depression, and anxiety are common among veterans. Many carry invisible scars that affect them for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Survivor’s guilt is the painful feeling of having lived while others did not. Soldiers may wonder “Why them and not me?” This guilt can lead to depression, self-isolation, or even suicidal thoughts if not addressed.</p>

        <p>War exposes soldiers to intense danger: gunfire, explosions, burns, and hazardous environments. As a result, many return home with serious physical injuries, including:</p>

<p>Limb loss (amputations) from IEDs or blasts

Spinal cord injuries, leading to paralysis or limited mobility

Burns and disfigurement that require multiple surgeries

Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) from shockwaves, falls, or impact

Hearing or vision loss from loud explosions or bright flashes</p>

<p>These injuries can mean a lifetime of surgeries, physical therapy, prosthetics, or dependence on others for daily tasks.</p>

    <div class="imageparagraph">
    <div id="container">
        <div id="newBoxes"></div>
        <p>Civilians often become unintended—or sometimes deliberate—targets in war. Bombings, airstrikes, crossfire, and attacks on towns or cities can kill thousands in seconds. Children, the elderly, and families with no place to run are among the most at risk.

Entire communities can be wiped out. Homes become rubble. Streets that once held laughter are turned into silence and smoke.</p>
<p>Millions of civilians are forced to leave everything behind and run for their lives. They become refugees, crossing borders into foreign countries with only the clothes on their backs, or internally displaced, living in camps or broken shelters inside their own war-torn nation.

Refugees face:

Hunger and malnutrition

Disease outbreaks in overcrowded camps

Lack of clean water, medical care, and education

Xenophobia and rejection in places they flee to</p>

<p>War leaves deep emotional wounds. Children may grow up with constant fear, having seen death and violence at a young age. Many civilians—especially those who lose loved ones—develop PTSD, anxiety, or depression.

Even after a war ends, the emotional damage remains. People who survive war often carry invisible pain for the rest of their lives.
